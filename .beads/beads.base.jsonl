{"id":"hermes-9za","title":"Add Goodreads browser automation","description":"Add Goodreads browser automation so users can run `hermes import goodreads --automated` without manually fetching the CSV. The existing importer already assumes a local CSV via the `--input` flag (`cmd/root.go` and `cmd/goodreads/cmd.go`), so this work is purely about downloading that file automatically and then piping it back into the current parser.\n\n## Implementation outline\n\n1. **Dependencies \u0026 wiring**\n   - Add `github.com/chromedp/chromedp` (and the generated `cdproto` packages such as `github.com/chromedp/cdproto/page`) to `go.mod` / `go.sum`.\n   - Create `cmd/goodreads/automation.go` to keep the browser automation isolated from parsing logic.\n   - Introduce a seam such as `var downloadGoodreadsCSV = AutomateGoodreadsExport` inside the package so CLI tests can stub the automation when we exercise the new flags.\n\n2. **CLI / config surface (`cmd/root.go`, `config.yml`, docs)**\n   - Extend `GoodreadsCmd` with `Automated bool`, `GoodreadsEmail string`, `GoodreadsPassword string`, `Headful bool` (optional), `DownloadDir string`, and `AutomationTimeout time.Duration`. The `--automated` flag should skip the existing “input file required” validation, while the legacy CSV path still works when automation is disabled.\n   - Bind those fields to config keys via Viper so users can keep credentials outside the CLI invocation, e.g. `goodreads.automation.email`, `.password`, `.headful`, `.download_dir`, `.timeout`. Document how to source them from environment variables to avoid storing plaintext in repos.\n   - When `--automated` is set, resolve the credentials (flag \u003e env \u003e config), build an `AutomationOptions` struct, and call the automation helper before continuing with `parseGoodreads(...)`. Re‑use the `cmdutil.SetupOutputDir` flow so we do not duplicate business logic.\n\n3. **Automation flow (`cmd/goodreads/automation.go`)**\n   - Define `type AutomationOptions struct { Email, Password, DownloadDir string; Headless bool; Timeout time.Duration }` and `func AutomateGoodreadsExport(ctx context.Context, opts AutomationOptions) (string, error)`.\n   - Inside the helper:\n     * Create a chromedp allocator (`chromedp.NewExecAllocator`) with sane defaults (`chromedp.Flag(\"headless\", opts.Headless)`, `chromedp.Flag(\"disable-gpu\", true)`, `chromedp.Flag(\"disable-sync\", true)`, etc.) and ensure downloads land inside a temporary directory (use `page.SetDownloadBehavior(page.SetDownloadBehaviorBehaviorAllow).WithDownloadPath(tmpDir)`).\n     * Navigate to `https://www.goodreads.com/user/sign_in`, wait for the login form (`input[name=\"user[email]\"]`, `input[name=\"user[password]\"]`), fill credentials, and submit.\n     * Block until the profile avatar / site header loads (e.g. wait for `.siteHeader__topLevelItem--profile` to become visible) so we know authentication succeeded.\n     * Navigate to `https://www.goodreads.com/review/import`, click the “Export Library” button (`//input[@value='Export Library']`), and poll for the generated download link (`a[href*=\"goodreads_library_export.csv\"]`). Goodreads queues exports, so wrap this portion in a retry loop with a user-configurable timeout (default 2–3 minutes) and surface helpful log lines via `slog`.\n     * Once the CSV download finishes, return the on-disk path; copy/move it into the location Hermes already expects (`goodreads_library_export.csv` inside the working directory or under `exports/`), and make sure callers clean up temporary directories.\n   - Guard rails: bubble up authentication failures with actionable errors, redact passwords in logs, and respect `context.WithTimeout` from the caller so Ctrl‑C cancels the headless browser cleanly.\n\n4. **Parser integration**\n   - Refactor `cmd/goodreads/cmd.go` / `ParseGoodreadsWithParams` so the resulting CSV path (manual or automated) is injected via function parameters instead of mutating the global `csvFile` var directly. This keeps automation from having to know about package-level globals and will make it easier to test.\n   - After automation delivers the CSV, set `csvFile` to that temp path, then run the existing `ParseGoodreads` exactly as today so markdown/JSON/sqlite flows stay untouched.\n\n5. **Testing**\n   - Extend `cmd/goodreads/cmd_test.go` to cover the new `--automated` path by faking `downloadGoodreadsCSV` and asserting that `parseGoodreadsFunc` receives the generated file path and that `--input` stays optional when automation is enabled.\n   - Add targeted unit tests for any pure helpers in `automation.go` (e.g., selector builders, timeout calculation). For browser actions, lean on dependency injection so we can provide a mock chromedp runner and avoid launching Chrome during tests.\n\n6. **Docs \u0026 release notes**\n   - Update `docs/importers/goodreads.md` (and the README import section) with an “Automated export” subsection that documents the new flags, config block, required dependencies (Chrome/Chromium installed, headless by default), and security guidance for credentials.\n   - Mention the new workflow in `CHANGELOG` / release notes if applicable and remind contributors to run `task build` to pick up the `chromedp` dependency.\n\nCompletion criteria: running `hermes import goodreads --automated --goodreads-email $EMAIL --goodreads-password $PASSWORD` downloads the latest CSV with chromedp, pipes it through the current importer, and all `task build` checks pass.","status":"open","priority":4,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-19T00:11:42.393974+02:00","updated_at":"2025-11-19T09:33:58.461935+02:00"}
