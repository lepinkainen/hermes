# Hermes Project Rules

## Core Guidelines

- **Language:** Go only (no Python or other languages)
- **Build System:** Use Taskfile
- **CLI Framework:** Cobra and Viper for commands and configuration
- **Purpose:** See README.md for project definition

## Code Structure

- All import processors go under the `cmd/` directory
- Each processor has its own subdirectory and Go package

## Implementation Requirements

- Maintain consistent Go style and idiomatic patterns
- Follow the existing architectural patterns
- Each data source processor should be implemented as a separate command
