# Obsidian Markdown Utilities

This package is intended to remain a generic, reusable library for working with
Obsidian-style Markdown (frontmatter, tags, note parsing/serialization).

Do not add Hermes- or application-specific logic here. Keep domain-specific
builders and helpers in the main application packages.
